<!--<h1>The Roots of Shamayoga</h1>-->
<div id="roots-text">
<p>Rooted in the ancient classical Hatha style, Shamayoga is an inspired and integrated eclectic
approach to learning and teaching yoga in the 21st century.</p>
<p>In the yoga tradition Shama refers to the conscious harmony of the Whole Self – awareness,
body, mind and emotions. In the Vedas (India’s oldest sacred texts) the word Yoga is used
alongside the word Shama, meaning harmonious union. To me, this suggests the idea of inner
harmony and the profound connection between our inner world and the Universe itself. Yoga is
there to help us explore this mystical connection in a balanced and harmonious way.</p>
<p>For Yoga Practioners wanting to deepen and share their knowledge we offer a one year (200hrs)
internationally recognised Yoga Alliance certificated teacher training course covering all aspects
of yoga practice, theory and teaching.</p>
<p>For beginners and advanced alike we offer ongoing yoga classes, workshops,yoga
retreats andambient albums andfilm.</p>
<p>All styles and spiritual paths warmly welcomed.</p>
