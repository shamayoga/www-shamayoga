    "I have thoroughly enjoyed Steve's Yoga Teacher Training. It covered all
    aspects of yoga, from the more physical asanas to meditation and relaxation
    techniques, as well as working with energy, and the broader aspects of the
    philosophy of yoga. <br />Basically it gave me the opportunity to approach
    yoga as a lifestyle rather than just a body/mind exercise. It taught me how
    to integrate yoga into every aspect of my daily life. By the end of the
    course I felt confident that I could stand in front of a class and teach
    yoga.<br />The poses were analysed in depth, in particular under the point
    of view of correct alignment. I also loved the specific classes about
    teaching yoga to children or pregnant women. <br />Steve manages to give his
    students a good understanding of all aspects of yoga, and at the same time
    each aspect is studied in depth. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of his
    classes, where I met lovely people who I am now friends with. <br />I would
    recommend Steve's Yoga Teacher Training to anyone who wants to become a yoga
    teacher , and also to anyone who wants to experience yoga from a deeper
    point of view than that of a normal yoga class.<br />Roberta"

    "A comprehensive and professional course that has managed to capture a real
    personal feel to it. I am enjoying every moment! I think the course is
    suitable for a real range of people- our group consists of experienced
    teachers through to people that just wish to expand their knowledge and
    enjoyment of Yoga.<br />Every weekend is like going on a retreat to
    recharge!"
- student: Tina (Halstead)
  testimony: >-
    "The course that Steve runs is well organised with a good balance of
    academic and practical work. It also includes a teaching practice every
    other month, which for me is invaluable as I came to the course with no
    teaching experience at all. Steve is very supportive and eager to hear our
    views on different aspects of the course and it's guest lectures. So far I
    have found the course very enjoyable, I have already learnt so much more
    about yoga and it's practice."
- student: Sara (Shardlow)
  testimony: >-
    "I am really enjoying learning about all the different aspects of yoga and
    am gaining huge personal benefits; my own practice is much more focused and
    rewarding and my confidence in teaching is growing. The weekends are intense
    with lots to learn but thanks to the tutors and the students they are also
    fun and interesting."
- student: Caroline (Dickson)
  testimony: >-
    "I am really enjoying the course. I have taught yoga for several years
    already but am finding the course invaluable - it is inspiring me again,
    reminding me of details I've forgotten and filling in gaps in my knowledge.
    Working in isolation as a teacher can be difficult and its great to meet
    such lovely people and be able to discuss things with them. The weekends are
    quite intense with the time well filled and I feel I have learned alot at
    the end of each one. I particularly value the informal atmosphere Steve has
    created on the course, and the practical, hands on approach."

    variety of teachers throughout the course, with differing experiences and
    backgrounds; this adds diversity and depth of knowledge to the teaching
    practice. Steve is a great teacher with a real passion for yoga, he brings
    focus and attention to all the different aspects of yoga. The true spirit of
    yoga is definitely emphasised."
- student: Kris (Williamson)
  testimony: >-
    "Lots of variety, plenty to think about and work with. We are improving
    techniques, working with partners and expanding what we already know and
    learning more. Various tutors bring their expertise and experience to share
    with us. The workshops are very practical with lots of time to ask questions
    and explore."

  testimony: >-
    "I'm learning so much on this course. It is interesting to take things
    beyond just physical movement and into more spiritual territory than I am
    used to. Steve and Olivia seem like ideal guides on my yoga journey - they
    always seem to have answers to my questions and I look forward to the rest
    of the course. Back on the physical stuff, the tutors seems to know an awful
    lot. I think between the instructors I am in safe hands and will improve my
    yoga practice on all levels."

    I wasn't sure what to expect but it wasn't this! I really like the spiritual

    It is nice to have a variety of guest speakers."

    "The course is comprehensive, well structured and enjoyable. It has been
    very informative for me and I feel I have gained valuable knowledge which

    class="photo-right"/><br />"When I enrolled for the course I wanted to learn
    more about the different aspects of yoga, and expand from a knowledge base
    of just asanas. I was open minded when I began the course and I have not
    been disappointed. My fellow students are from such varied backgrounds that
    we all gain from the knowledge and gifts everyone brings to the group.<br
    />"The course teaches on instruction and practice, whilst encouraging self
    reflection and you find that although we teach each other, we also teach
    ourselves as we are opened up to unexplored areas of yoga."
- student: Helen (Taylor)
  testimony: >-
    "Before I started the course, my knowledge of Yoga as a whole was very
    basic, I had experienced Pranayama and Meditation and knew about Chakras and
    obviously had practised Asanas.<br />However, through the guidance and
    teachings of Steve, I feel that I have learned a lot more than I expected.
    Steve has obviously spent a lot of time preparing for each class as well as
    the handouts which we receive each month.<br />He creates a relaxing
    atmosphere and puts everyone at ease whilst still providing some really
    interesting classes! I think that I can vouch for the whole group that
    whilst he is our teacher, I imagine that he will be a very good lifelong
    friend."

    unfold!"

    "Doing the Yoga teacher training course, was a soul enriching experience. I
    have gained and learned lots of new skills, enhanced my development and
    broadened my understandings and views to Yoga and its philosophies. <br
    />Steve provides an in-depth and detailed approach to yoga, with a
    thoughtful attitude and consideration for everyone within the class. Each
    day was filled with a variety of lessons, physical and spiritual. <br />The
    course has given me the confidence and knowledge to teach others in a
    practical and sound approach, taking into regard each person on an
    individual path. <br />I have gained so much from this course and would
    recommend it to anyone wishing to study yoga, teach yoga or/and just to
    broaden ones horizons. <br />An excellent course. Many thanks for all the
    time, care and effort put into my progress"
- student: Sue (Fidler)
  testimony: >-
    "A creative course that explores all aspects of yoga from the ancient
    philosophies to new age beliefs. It assists on the physical level of
    teaching asanas and pranayama whilst also allowing exploration of the
    meditive and spiritual realms. <br />Steve's gentle and non-dogmatic
    approach encourages development of your own personal style, and the sharing
    of the whole group's knowledge and experience, invaluable. <br />A
    thoroughly enjoyable course which shall be missed along with everyone
    involved!"
- student: Gareth (Watkins)
  testimony: >-
    "I have really enjoyed the Teacher Training Course - intensive learning in a
    very relaxed atmosphere.<br />I like the emphasis upon using your own
    creativity and practising the yoga that feels right for you.<br />The
    discussions upon yogic philosophy are very thought-provoking and the
    bi-monthly teaching practises have been a gentle and fun way of introducing
    us to the world of teaching."
- student: Martin 'Rootsy' King
  testimony: >-
    "Steve's obviously laid-back nature, his wealth of knowledge on the universe
    that is yoga and an openness to his own continued learning ooze out of his
    teaching practice.<br />With an eccletic blend of structured, classical yoga
    styles and theory, spontaneous teachings on everything from dealing with
    knee injuries to end-time prophecies, Steve's own unique yoga dances and
    endless opportunities for students to grow and gain confidence, this course
    is a must for anyone seeking that little bit more than your average yogi
    bear."

  testimony: >-
    "I am so pleased I made the decision to do this course!<br />Steve's deep
    passion for yoga is very inspiring. His knowledge and understanding of the
    principles of yoga are invaluable. With a friendly teaching style and
    respect for everybody's unique needs he understands how to bring out the
    best in his students.<br />Opportunities to teach at bi-monthly workshops
    are a great way to explore and experience teaching. Steve encouraged me to
    find my inner yoga teacher and I now enjoy teaching yoga with a confidence I
    would never have imagined.<br />The relaxed atmosphere brought our group
    together and every weekend was a joy with lots of laughter.<br />This was a
    magical, life enriching course that also gave a solid grounding in teaching
    yoga.<br />I can't thank you enough Steve."

  testimony: >-
    "I have just completed an excellent year's course with Steve Avian at the
    Shamayoga School in Sheffield which is endorsed by the Yoga Alliance. It has
    been a great mix of practice and theory -improving and adjusting postures
    and exploring and researching the wider meaning of Yoga. We were also
    introduced to and learned from other practitioners working and applying
    their knowledge of yoga in many different fields.<br />Throughout the course
    Steve encouraged us gently and gave us the opportunity to teach others,
    which although daunting at the time, has proved to be invaluable as I now,
    recently qualified, have to organise, plan and face my own classes.<br
    />Finally, it has been an extremely enjoyable journey. I have met some great
    people on the way and we have laughed a lot. Steve is a great teacher,
    friendly, open and receptive but at the same time focussed on our
    development and progression."
- student: Christine (Blyth)
  testimony: >-
    "To say I finished my workshop with Steve a different person wouldn't be an
    exaggeration.Throughout my year I experienced all the emotions! Plenty of
    laughter(and tears)I found my spiritual self dare I say for the first time
    and this will stand me in good stead for my journey ahead.<br />The way
    Steve allowed me to openly express myself is testament to his style of
    teaching.Many thanks again for making my time so rewarding both physically
    and spiritually."
- student: Sine (Campbell)
  testimony: >-
    "Having just completed Steve's Yoga teacher training course, I am already
    missing it greatly! I would recommend anyone who has a passion for yoga, who
    wants to teach Yoga or who just wants to deepen their knowledge to sign up
    for the course today!<br />The course was everything I expected it to me,
    and so much more. Its a fantastic mix of ancient yoga philosophy, theory and
    practical work - also including a good amount of teaching practise.<br />I
    really don't know what part of the course I enjoyed the most - every month
    has a new topic from Chakra's, Mantra's, Mudra's and exploring and
    understanding ancient yogic texts. Most Sunday's we'd get into deep
    philosophical discussions which I really enjoyed. My personal physical
    practise has vastly improved as has my knowledge of pranayama and
    meditation.<br />Steve's own knowledge is vast and he has a fantastic
    teaching style which is open and encouraging. I am definitely ready to start
    teaching yoga and to set up my own class.<br />I am seriously going to miss
    the yoga weekends, Steve and the wonderful people I met on the course. Take
    care xx"
