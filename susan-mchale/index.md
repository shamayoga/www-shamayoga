<div style="text-align: left;">My yoga journey started in 1981 in Australia when I travelled with an Iyengar yoga teacher who taught me asana and took me to a retreat to learn Vipassana meditation technique with Goenkaji. Later in Sheffield, after starting a family, I found an Iyengar yoga teacher, Linda Ogle, and was happy building my own personal yoga practice for a few years until she moved to another part of the country.  I did not find another teacher for a while. 

Then I found Steve Avian and Shamayoga, which I immediately sensed had the approach to yoga development that I was looking for. My foundational yoga teacher training was a Yoga Alliance International 200 hours accreditation with Shamayoga UK in 2014.  

I trained with TSYP (The School of Yoga Practitioners) UK for a 500+ hours, which was also accredited by BWY (British Wheel of Yoga) in 2018 and am now a BCYT (British Council for Yoga Therapy) Yoga Therapist. I continue to connect with TSYP mentor, Andy Curtis-Payne, and Vedic chant tutor Helen Macpherson and as part of the TSYP sangha.

My background as an Occupational Therapist for 20 years in the NHS gave me a background in a range of physical and mental health services, neuromedicine, orthopaedic, CFS/ME service, acute mental health and the Early Intervention in Psychosis service. I developed various complimentary health skills, qualifying in MTI holistic massage therapy in 2011 and clinical hypnotherapy with Innervisions in 2015.

I deepened my knowledge anatomy and physiology with a professional level online training in ‘Yoga, Fascia and the new anatomy’ with Tom Myers in 2016 and I am currently studying an upgraded extension of the course, which is full of the latest developments in fascia research. I also am a member of the Fascia Hub.</diV>
