# &nbsp;Honouring Steve's Life and Contribution to Yoga


We regret to announce that Steve Avian passed away unexpectedly on Wednesday 17th November 2021.

Steve was deeply committed to yoga, devoting many years to studying and practising Hatha Yoga. He embraced all aspects of Yoga, its cultural and spiritual roots and philosophy - it was his life, and his life's work was enabling other people to experience the health benefits and to have the opportunity for the spiritual transformation that practising yoga can bring.

We will endeavour to honour his life and contribution to yoga by continuing the legacy of the Shamayoga school and community. We hope to resume yoga teacher training, classes and workshops led by Steve’s former business partner Susan McHale and other colleagues and graduates of Shamayoga school. Please bear with us as we reorganise and come to terms with Steve’s absence. Thank you.
