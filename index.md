testimonials:
 - name: Sarah(Atkin)
   testimony: An intensive, well paced course, exploring all the aspects of yoga. This course gives a solid basis from which to teach while allowing students to be creative and develop their own individual style.  A chance to contemplate the nature of your own spiritual journey and watch it begin to unfold!
 - name: Ruth (Robson)
   testimony: I am so pleased I made the decision to do this course!<br/>Steve's deep passion for yoga is very inspiring. His knowledge and understanding of the principles of yoga are invaluable. With a friendly teaching style and respect for everybody's unique needs he understands how to bring out the best in his students.<br/>Opportunities to teach at bi-monthly workshops are a great way to explore and experience teaching. Steve encouraged me to find my inner yoga teacher and I now enjoy teaching yoga with a confidence I would never have imagined.<br/>The relaxed atmosphere brought our group together and every weekend was a joy with lots of laughter.<br/>This was a magical, life enriching course that also gave a solid grounding in teaching yoga.<br/>I can't thank you enough Steve.
 - name: Andy (Chapman)

 - name: Anne Meadows
   testimony: Thank you so much.  It’s the best thing I’ve ever done. 
 - name: Lucette Henderson
   testimony: Thanks so much. Hugely appreciate all the teaching.  The pace, delivery, it feels spacious, nurturing, warming, very motivating.
 - name: Jo (Boltt)
   testimony: A comprehensive and professional course that has managed to capture a real personal feel to it. I am enjoying every moment! I think the course is suitable for a real range of people- our group consists of experienced teachers through to people that just wish to expand their knowledge and enjoyment of Yoga.<br/>Every weekend is like going on a retreat to recharge!
 - name: Roberta
   testimony: I have thoroughly enjoyed Steve's Yoga Teacher Training. It covered all aspects of yoga, from the more physical asanas to meditation and relaxation techniques, as well as working with energy, and the broader aspects of the philosophy of yoga.<br/>Basically it gave me the opportunity to approach yoga as a lifestyle rather than just a body/mind exercise. It taught me how to integrate yoga into every aspect of my daily life. By the end of the course I felt confident that I could stand in front of a class and teach yoga.<br/>The poses were analysed in depth, in particular under the point of view of correct alignment. I also loved the specific classes about teaching yoga to children or pregnant women.<br/>Steve manages to give his students a good understanding of all aspects of yoga, and at the same time each aspect is studied in depth. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of his classes, where I met lovely people who I am now friends with.<br/>I would recommend Steve's Yoga Teacher Training to anyone who wants to become a yoga teacher  and also to anyone who wants to experience yoga from a deeper point of view than that of a normal yoga class.

<!--<h1>The Roots of Shamayoga</h1>-->
<div id="roots-text">
<p class="drop-cap">If I could sum up my Yoga practice in one word, it would be "Shama".  Shama is a Sanskrit word  शम meaning inner harmony. </p>

<p>In the yoga tradition Shama refers to the conscious harmony of the Whole Self – body, mind and emotions. In the Vedas (India’s oldest sacred texts) the word Yoga is used alongside the word Shama, meaning harmonious union. </p>

<p>To me, this suggests the idea of inner harmony and the profound connection between our inner world and the Universe itself. Yoga is there to help us explore this mystical connection in a balanced way.</p>

<p>Rooted in the ancient traditions and classic Hatha style, Shamayoga is an inspired and integrated eclectic approach to learning and teaching yoga in the 21st century.</p>

<p>For Yoga Practioners wanting to deepen and share their knowledge we offer a one year (200hrs) internationally recognised Yoga Alliance certificated teacher training course covering all aspects of yoga practice, theory and teaching.</p>

<p>For beginners and advanced alike we offer ongoing yoga classes, workshops, yoga retreats and music for Yoga and relaxation.
All styles and spiritual paths warmly welcomed. </p>
