      An intensive, well paced course, exploring all the aspects of yoga. This
      course gives a solid basis from which to teach while allowing students to
      be creative and develop their own individual style.  A chance to
      contemplate the nature of your own spiritual journey and watch it begin to
      unfold!
  - name: Ruth Robson

      I am so pleased I made the decision to do this course!<br/>Steve's deep
      passion for yoga is very inspiring. His knowledge and understanding of the
      principles of yoga are invaluable. With a friendly teaching style and
      respect for everybody's unique needs he understands how to bring out the
      best in his students.<br/>Opportunities to teach at bi-monthly workshops
      are a great way to explore and experience teaching. Steve encouraged me to
      find my inner yoga teacher and I now enjoy teaching yoga with a confidence
      I would never have imagined.<br/>The relaxed atmosphere brought our group
      together and every weekend was a joy with lots of laughter.<br/>This was a
      magical, life enriching course that also gave a solid grounding in
      teaching yoga.<br/>I can't thank you enough Steve.

      Thanks so much. Hugely appreciate all the teaching.  The pace, delivery,

      A comprehensive and professional course that has managed to capture a real
      personal feel to it. I am enjoying every moment! I think the course is
      suitable for a real range of people- our group consists of experienced
      teachers through to people that just wish to expand their knowledge and
      enjoyment of Yoga.<br/>Every weekend is like going on a retreat to
      recharge!
  - name: Roberta Sutherland
    testimony: >-
      I have thoroughly enjoyed Steve's Yoga Teacher Training. It covered all
      aspects of yoga, from the more physical asanas to meditation and
      relaxation techniques, as well as working with energy, and the broader
      aspects of the philosophy of yoga.<br/>Basically it gave me the
      opportunity to approach yoga as a lifestyle rather than just a body/mind
      exercise. It taught me how to integrate yoga into every aspect of my daily
      life. By the end of the course I felt confident that I could stand in
      front of a class and teach yoga.<br/>The poses were analysed in depth, in
      particular under the point of view of correct alignment. I also loved the
      specific classes about teaching yoga to children or pregnant
      women.<br/>Steve manages to give his students a good understanding of all
      aspects of yoga, and at the same time each aspect is studied in depth. I
      also enjoyed the atmosphere of his classes, where I met lovely people who
      I am now friends with.<br/>I would recommend Steve's Yoga Teacher Training
      to anyone who wants to become a yoga teacher  and also to anyone who wants
      to experience yoga from a deeper point of view than that of a normal yoga
      class.

<div id="roots"><h1>शम योग</h1><div id="roots-text"><p class="drop-cap"><em>If I could sum up my Yoga practice in one word, it would be "Shama". Shama is a Sanskrit word meaning inner harmony.</em></p><p><em>In the yoga tradition Shama refers to the conscious harmony of the Whole Self &ndash; body, mind and emotions. In the Vedas (India&rsquo;s oldest sacred texts) the word Yoga is used alongside the word Shama, meaning harmonious union.</em></p><p><em>To me, this suggests the idea of inner harmony and the profound connection between our inner world and the Universe itself. Yoga is there to help us explore this mystical connection in a balanced way. </em><br /><em>- Steve Avian</em></p><p>Rooted in the ancient traditions and classic Hatha style, Shamayoga is an inspired and integrated eclectic approach to learning and teaching yoga in the 21st century.</p><p>For Yoga Practioners wanting to deepen and share their knowledge we offer a one year (200hrs) internationally recognised Yoga Alliance certificated teacher training course covering all aspects of yoga practice, theory and teaching.</p><p>For beginners and advanced alike we offer ongoing yoga classes, workshops, yoga retreats and music for Yoga and relaxation. All styles and spiritual paths warmly welcomed.</p></div></div>
